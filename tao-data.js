Military power is inherently negative, with \"thistles and thorns\" where troops camp symbolizing this negativity or, personally, resentment in the heart. Tao cultivators, while anti-violence, are not pacifists, ready to act when cornered, like many great Taoist generals and martial artists who used force only when necessary and without celebration. Empires, like all things contrary to the Tao, rise through force and decay from within, never lasting. Personally, this teaches deliberate skill: courtesy over aggression, a light touch over heavy tactics, consensus over forced will.",
